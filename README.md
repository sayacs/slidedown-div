# Slidedown Div

A simple HTML and JavaScript example of sliding down a fixed top div when scrolling down the page.

## Description

This project demonstrates how to create a sliding top bar (div) that becomes visible when scrolling down the page. It's a simple way to add a top bar or header that appears when users scroll down the page and disappears when they scroll up.

## How It Works

The sliding top bar is implemented using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. When the user scrolls down the page by a certain distance (in this example, 100 pixels), the top bar becomes visible by changing its `top` property from `-100px` to `0` using JavaScript. When the user scrolls up, it hides the top bar by changing the `top` property back to `-100px`.

## Usage

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Scroll down the page to see the sliding top bar in action.

Feel free to customize the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to fit your specific needs.
